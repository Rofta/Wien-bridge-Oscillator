# Wien-bridge-Oscillator
The Wien bridge oscillator is a sine wave generator that uses an RC feedback network to set the oscillation frequency and an amplifier with controlled gain. At the oscillation frequency the network provides zero phase shift and requires a gain of about three, with amplitude stabilized using a lamp or JFET for low distortion.
